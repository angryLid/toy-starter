<h1 align="center">Toy Starter</h1>

The purpose of this boilerplate is for developing toy projects.

## Feature

* **React**, I dislike it, but I'd like to take advantage of its ecosystem.
* **React Router**, probably it's almost neccesary in a react App.
* **Redux Toolkit**, I have to admit Redux is vorbose, but its devtool is great.
* **Ant Design**, I even don't want to write Tailwind's classes.
* **Rsbuild**, a Vite challenger.


## What's Not Included

* **Testing**, come on, don't pretend you'll write test code for an entertainment project.
* **Prettier**, just use the VSCode built-in formatter.
* **Sass or Less**, vanilla CSS is enough, it even supports nesting now.
* **Web request library**, it's included in RTK Query.

## Optional

* **TypeScript**
* **ESLint**, I choose airbnb config without any git hook which can be ignored by turning the extension off.

## How to use

```
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/angryLid/toy-starter.git

npm install

npm start
```

## Roadmap
* support Electron 
* support browser extention
